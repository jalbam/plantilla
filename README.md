Description

Powerful online shop engine highly confirable, cross-platform and cross-browser.

Automatically detects JavaScript support. JavaScript is not needed but it is used it in the case it is available (for example, to detect screen resolution so that the PHP engine can know it).

If the admin wants, a lot of very useful data about the client will be sent to the desired email.

It doesn't use any databases at all but just plain text files that have to be edited to be configured. In the case that someone happens to want to use this shop engine, programming knowledge is not necessary at all. Editing text files and placing product images in a certain folder is enough.
